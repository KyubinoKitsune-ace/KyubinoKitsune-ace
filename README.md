## About me

Senior AI/ML + Product Engineer focused on shipping production-grade AI systems end-to-end.

I bring 4 years of AI/ML engineering experience and 5 years of AI product engineering experience, turning models into reliable, scalable features with measurable business impact.

AI in industry is moving from "chatbots" to full systems: agentic workflows, retrieval + reasoning, measurable evaluations, secure enterprise deployments, and cost/latency-aware serving. That is where I build.

## What I build

- **AI agents and tool-using workflows**: routing, state machines, fallbacks, permissions, safety controls
- **LLM/NLP products**: RAG assistants, summarization, extraction, classification, relevance/reranking
- **ML/DL systems**: training -> evaluation -> deployment -> monitoring (drift and data quality)
- **Data and big data pipelines**: batch/stream processing, analytics-ready datasets, experimentation loops
- **Fullstack AI products**: APIs, dashboards, multi-tenant platforms, usage metering, SLAs

## Core stack

- **Languages**: Python, SQL, TypeScript, Bash (plus Rust/Go/C++/Java as needed)
- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, Tailwind, MUI, Chakra UI, shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: FastAPI/Django, NestJS/Express, REST/gRPC, WebSockets, auth (JWT/OAuth)
- **Data**: PostgreSQL (pgvector), Redis, MongoDB/DynamoDB, Elasticsearch/OpenSearch, vector DBs (Pinecone/Weaviate/Milvus/FAISS), BigQuery/Snowflake/Redshift
- **MLOps/Infra**: Docker, Kubernetes/ECS, Terraform, GitHub Actions, Airflow/Dagster/Prefect, Kafka/PubSub/Kinesis, OpenTelemetry/Prometheus/Grafana, ELK, Sentry, MLflow/W&B

## Engineering principles

I care about correctness, reliability, maintainability, and observability, with pragmatic tradeoffs between accuracy, latency, and cost.

## Collaboration

If you are building agentic AI or production ML systems, I am happy to collaborate.
